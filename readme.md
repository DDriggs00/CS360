# Natural Language parser to SQL Query

This program is designed to convert a natural language input query, such as `show me the games that were made in 2017`, convert it into a SQL query, such as `select game from games where year = 2017`, and execute it in MySQL.

This program is designed to read from a database, NOT write to it.
